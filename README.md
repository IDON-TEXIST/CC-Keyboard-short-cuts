# cc-Keyboard-short-cuts
Ok so yeah I don't know how to code so this won't be formatted <br>
All this is is I took the keyboard shortcut java script code from https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Add-Ons <br>
and put it into a type of code that greasemonkey can run on cookie clicker<br>
th-thats it <br>
I literally did not write any of this code, all credit goes to whoever wrote that lol <br>
