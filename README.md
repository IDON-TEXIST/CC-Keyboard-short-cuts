# cc-Keyboard-short-cuts
Ok so yeah I don't know how to code so this won't be formatted <br>
All this is is I took the keyboard shortcut java script code from https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Add-Ons <br>
and put it into a type of code that userscript can run on cookie clicker<br>
th-thats it <br>
I literally did not write any of this code, all credit goes to whoever wrote that lol <br>
You can run with bookmarklet or console with index.js <br>
To use with userscript use coolerindex.js <br> 
go to the applicable documentation for the manager you use <br>
That is all
