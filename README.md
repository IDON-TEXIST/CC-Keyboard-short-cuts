# Cookie-Clicker-Keyboard-shortcuts
This is an extension I totally stole from 2 different people for Cookie Clicker.   
"Well what purpose does this repo serve?" you ask. Well, the code for this only exists as source code and what I did is a took that and used Github's raw info page thingy so that this could be loaded and used as a userscript so you no longer have to enter anything into the console.
They're keyboard shortcuts. You can add them and they'll automatically apply whenever you open cookie clicker.   
It can do the following things:   
* M to open options
* S to open stats
* U to open info
* C to open Cookie Monster menu (different addon, [/Aktanusa/CookieMonster](https://github.com/Aktanusa/CookieMonster) DOES NOT WORK WITH LATEST VERSION)
* F to open Frozen Cookies menu (Also a different addon, [/Icehawk78/FrozenCookies/](https://github.com/Icehawk78/FrozenCookies/))  
Besides the 2 add-ons listed above and [/Icehawk78/CookieCrate](https://github.com/fmahnke/CookieCrate), this add on *will* break when combining with other add-ons, and you can only have one at a time.

Yup. I didn't actually do anything. I would like to say that again, that all I did is combine 2 templates. Don't come running at me with a pitchfork please.
