# cc-Keyboard-short-cuts
Ok so yeah I don't know how to code so this won't be formatted <br>
All this is is I took the keyboard shortcut java script code from https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Add-Ons <br>
and put it into a type of code that userscript can run on cookie clicker<br>
th-thats it <br>
I literally did not write any of this code, all credit goes to whoever wrote that lol <br>
You can run with bookmarklet or console with index.js <br>
To use with userscript use coolerindex.js <br> 
go to the applicable documentation for the manager you use <br>
That is all <br>
I probably broke like 17 copyright laws <br>
Crap I just realized fandom is licesned under CC-BY-SA <br>

Half of this is people deleting everything and others reverting the everything delete <br> 
Ok I give up, find the source yourself, no one's ever gonna look at this anyway <br> 
Pretend it's liscensed with CC-BY-SA too cause I don't think I can do a more open liscense since I'm using one with a less open one <br>
Also credit to /Aktanusa/CookieMonster for giving the template for running a mod as a userscript on cookie clicker <br>
Yea I did literally nothing besides this readme myself <br>
This is an extra sentence because I forgot to write a commit name
